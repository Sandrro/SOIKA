Services extraction
==========================
The City_services class is designed to extract city service names from text using a string comparison algorithm, taking into account
the changing service endings in the text. Using the flair library, the City_services.run() method in messages extracts named entities 
from the Sentence object as a list, as well as the most probable service type, and stores them in new columns of the original DataFrame().
