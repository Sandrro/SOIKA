Main pipeline
===================

By selecting a limited urbanized area and a list of online communities in a social network,
it is possible to run this dataset across all major library functions. However, in some cases,
the order in which they are run is important.

   SOIKA's sections

The main sections were divided into:
* Data receiving (a step possible to skip only if there is already geolocated
text data mentioning urban sites, otherwise the steps are very important - :ref:`data_getter` and :ref:`geocoder` )

* Data tagging: Characterization of messages and urban objects, which can be carried out in any order: :ref:`emotion_classifier` :ref:`text_classifier` :ref:`city_services` :ref:`topic_modeler`

* Data modelling: Section consists of further synthesis of the obtained data, risk assessment and forecasting. Each of the methods in this group requires certain labeling columns: :ref:`sem_graph` :ref:`regional_activity`

* Data visualization: The last step is applied to the already generated semantic graph - :ref:`graph_visualization`
